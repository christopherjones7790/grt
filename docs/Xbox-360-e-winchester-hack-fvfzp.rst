We still working on something cool for Xbox , but is a few months away, and hopefully it will work also on Winchester, but we are still a while away from releasing details about the product. Stay tuned to our TX main website, or TX forums, when there is news it will be posted there! Thanks.-=(TXUser Interaction Count: 5. I have Xbox E /12 and it has Winchester.
