Basically you'll follow the directions on the box replacing the 1 cup of water with milk, adding two extra eggs, and swapping the ⅓ cup oil for. Add an extra egg (or two if you want the cupcakes to be very rich, or if you're using medium eggs). More information. Cake Mix Cupcakes. Cupcake Mix. Box Cake Mix. Cake Mixes. Box Cake Recipes.
